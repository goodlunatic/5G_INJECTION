**Sni5Gect** is a framework for sniffing unencrypted 5G messages and injecting custom packets into the over-the-air communication between a base station and a User Equipment (UE). It can be used for security research to perform attacks like crashing UE modems, network downgrades, fingerprinting, and auth bypass. The tool has been tested with commercial UEs (smartphones, modems) and srsRAN/Effnet base stations.

#### Core Features
* 🔎 Sniff: Capture 5G MAC-NR unencrypted messages between the base station and UE.
* 💉 Inject: Send arbitrary MAC-NR messages to a target UE/base station at specific communication states.
#### Example Use Cases
* 💥 Crash UE modems.
* 📉 Downgrade attacks (5G to 4G).
* 👆 Device Fingerprinting.
* 👹 Anomaly Detection.

*Sni5Gect artifacts paper received badges **Available**, **Functional** and **Reproduced** in the 34th USENIX Security Symposium. Artifacts PDF available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asset-group/Sni5Gect-5GNR-sniffing-and-exploitation/main/docs/_media/USENIX_Security__25_Artifact_Appendix__SNI5GECT__A_Practical_Approach_to_Inject_aNRchy_into_5G_NR.pdf)*

## Overview

![Sni5Gect Overview](./images/sni5gect-overview.png)

## Quick Start via Docker

We recommend running the entire stack within an Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container to ensure consistent dependencies and avoid affecting the local environment.

Build and Start the Docker Container:

```bash
docker compose build sni5gect # Build container
docker compose up -d sni5gect # Start Container
docker exec -it sni5gect bash # Access Container
./build/shadower/shadower configs/srsran-n78-20MHz-b210.yaml # Run Sniffer for Band N78 with 20MHz Bandwidth
# See Running Sni5Gect in the README.md
```

- Distance: 0 meter to up to 20 meters (with amplifier)

An example srsRAN base station configuration is available at `configs/base_station/srsran-n78-20MHz.yml`.

## Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

Sni5Gect utilizes a USRP Software Defined Radio (SDR) device to send and receive IQ samples during communication between a legitimate 5G base station and a UE. The following SDRs are supported:

- USRP B210 SDR
- USRP x310 SDR

Host Machine Recommendations:

- Minimum: 12-core CPU
- 16 GB RAM

Our setup consists of an AMD 5950x processor with 32 GB of memory.

### Software Requirements

- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 (containerized environment)
- Note: The host should be dedicated to Sni5Gect without resource-intensive applications (e.g., GUI) to prevent SDR overflows.

#### Sni5Gect leverages the following software components

- [wDissector](https://github.com/asset-group/5ghoul-5g-nr-attacks) for analyzing over-the-air traffic.
- [Wireshark display filters](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/) to identify communication states.

Sni5Gect builds upon [srsRAN 4G](https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_4G) utilizing features such as SSB search, PBCH decoding, PDCCH decoding, PDSCH encoding/decoding, and PUSCH decoding.

### Evaluated Devices

## Running Sni5Gect

The Sni5Gect executable is located in the `build/shadower` directory, and configuration files are available in the `configs` folder.

### Running with Example Connection Recording

The easiest way to get started with Sni5Gect is to run it using a pre-recorded IQ sample file. We've provided a sample for offline testing.

1. Download and Extract the example recording file from Zenodo:

```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/records/15601773/files/example-connection-samsung-srsran.zip
unzip example-connection-samsung-srsran.zip
```

2. Edit `configs/config-srsran-n78-20MHz.conf` and modify the `source` section as follows:

```yaml
source:
  source_type: file
  source_params: /root/sni5gect/example_connection/example.fc32

rf:
  sample_rate: 23.04e6
  num_channels: 1
  uplink_cfo: 0 # Uplink Carrier Frequency Offset correction in Hz
  downlink_cfo: 0 # Downlink Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) in Hz
```

3. Finally launch the sniffer using:

```bash
./build/shadower/shadower configs/srsran-n78-20MHz-b210.yaml
```

You should see output similar to the screenshot below:
![Example recording](./images/example_recording.png)

### Running with an SDR (Live Sniffing)

To test Sni5Gect with a live over-the-air signal using a Software Defined Radio (SDR), update the configuration file to use the SDR as the source.

Example `source` and `rf` Section for UHD-compatible SDR (e.g., USRP B200)

```yaml
source:
  source_type: uhd
  source_params: type=b200,master_clock_rate=23.04e6

rf:
  sample_rate: 23.04e6
  num_channels: 1
  uplink_cfo: -0.00054 # Uplink Carrier Frequency Offset correction in Hz
  downlink_cfo: 0 # Downlink Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) in Hz
  padding:
    front_padding: 0 # Number of IQ samples to pad in front of each burst
    back_padding: 0 # Number of IQ samples to pad at the end of each burst
  channels:
    - rx_frequency: 3427.5e6
      tx_frequency: 3427.5e6
      rx_offset: 0
      tx_offset: 0
      rx_gain: 40
      tx_gain: 80
      enable: true
```

Then start the sniffer with:

```bash
./build/shadower/shadower configs/srsran-n78-20MHz-b210.yaml
```

Upon startup, Sni5Gect will do the following:

1. Search for the base station using the specified center and SSB frequencies.
2. Retrieve cell configuration from SIB1.
3. Detect RAR messages indicating a new UE connecting to the target base station.

## Exploit Modules

The exploit modules are designed to provide a flexible way to load different attacks or exploits. When receiving a message, it will first be sent to wDissector to analyze the packet and if the packet matches with any [Wireshark display filters](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/dfref/) specified, it will react according to the `post_dissection` specified, either to inject messages to the communication or to extract certain fields.

### Sniffing: DL/UL & DCI

This module performs passive sniffing. The wDissector framework dissects packets and provides summaries of received packets.

```conf
exploit: modules/lib_dummy.so 
```

Example output:
![Sniffing Example Output](./images/sniffing_example_output.png)

#### DCI Sniffing

To monitor decoded DCI (Downlink Control Information) messages in real time, set the following logging configuration:

```conf
worker_log_level = DEBUG
```

With this setting, the sniffer logs detailed DCI-related information, including:

- DCI UL (Uplink Scheduling)
- PUSCH decoding results
- DCI DL (Downlink Scheduling)
- PDSCH decoding results

Example output:

```bash
[D] [    0] DCI UL slot 6732 17503: c-rnti=0x4601 dci=0_0 ss=common0 L=2 cce=0 f_alloc=0x498 t_alloc=0x0 hop=n mcs=9 ndi=1 rv=0 harq_id=0 tpc=1

```

### Crash: 5Ghoul Attacks

These exploits are taken from paper [5Ghoul: Unleashing Chaos on 5G Edge Devices](https://asset-group.github.io/disclosures/5ghoul/). These affect the MTK modems of the OnePlus Nord CE2.

|CVE|Module|
|---|------|
|CVE-2023-20702|lib_mac_sch_rrc_setup_crash_var.so|
|CVE-2023-32843|lib_mac_sch_mtk_rrc_setup_crash_3.so|
|CVE-2023-32842|lib_mac_sch_mtk_rrc_setup_crash_4.so|
|CVE-2024-20003|lib_mac_sch_mtk_rrc_setup_crash_6.so|
|CVE-2023-32845|lib_mac_sch_mtk_rrc_setup_crash_7.so|

Upon receiving the `RRC Setup Request` message from the UE, Sni5Gect replies with malformed `RRC Setup` to the target UE. If the UE accepts such malformed `RRC Setup` message, it crashes immediately, this can be confirmed from the adb log containing the keyword `sModemReason`, which indicates the MTK modem crashes. For example:

```
MDMKernelUeventObserver: sModemEvent: modem_failure
MDMKernelUeventObserver: sModemReason:fid:1567346682;cause:[ASSERT] file:mcu/l1/nl1/internal/md97/src/rfd/nr_rfd_configdatabase.c line:4380 p1:0x00000001
```

### Downgrade: Registration Reject

Utilizes the TC11 attack from the paper [Never Let Me Down Again: Bidding-Down Attacks and Mitigations in 5G and 4G](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3558482.3581774).  Injects a `Registration Reject` message after receiving a `Registration Request` from the UE, causing it to disconnect from 5G and downgrade to 4G. Since the base station may not be aware of the disconnection, it may keep sending the messages such as `Security Mode Command`, `Identity Request`, `Authentication Request`, etc.

```conf
exploit: modules/lib_dg_registration_reject.so 
```

Example Output:
![Registration Reject Example output](./images/registration_reject_output.png)

### Fingerprinting: Identity Request

Demonstrates a fingerprinting attack by injecting an `Identity Request` message after receiving a `Registration Request`. If the UE accepts, it responds with an `Identity Response` containing its SUCI information.

```conf
exploit: modules/lib_identity_request.so 
```

Example output:
![Identity Request Fingerprinting Example Output](./images/identity_request_output.png)

### Downgrade: Authentication Replay

This exploit corresponds to `CVD-2024-0096`. It is the most complex exploit we have, involving two stages: sniffing and replaying. During the replaying stage, it requires sniffing and injecting at multiple different states.

1. Sniffing: Capture a legitimate Authentication Request from the base station to the UE.

```conf
exploit: modules/lib_dg_authentication_request_sniffer.so 
```

2. Replaying: Update `shadower/modules/dg_authentication_replay.cc` with the captured MAC-NR values. Rebuild the module:

```bash
ninja -C build
```

Then load the module:

```conf
exploit: modules/lib_dg_authentication_replay.so
```

Upon receiving `Registration Request` from the UE, Sni5Gect replays the captured `Authentication Request` message to the target UE. Upon receiving the replayed `Authentication Request` message, the UE replies with `Authentication Failure` message with cause `Synch Failure` and starts the timer T3520. Then Sni5Gect updates its RLC and PDCP sequence number accordingly and replays the `Authentication Request` message for a few more times. Eventually, after multiple attempts and timer T3520 expires, the UE deems that the network has failed the authentication check, locally releases the communication, and treats the active cell as barred. If no other 5G base station is available, then the UE will downgrade to 4G and persists in downgrade status up to 300 seconds according to the specification 3GPP TS 24.501 version 16.5.1 Release 16 `5.4.1.2.4.5 Abnormal cases in the UE`. (Some phones may stay in downgrade status for much longer time).

In the example output, we can identify that the UE replies with the `Authentication Failure` message two times in the following screenshot.
![Authentication Replay Attack Example output](./images/authentication_replay_output.png)

### Authentication Bypass: Registration Accept 5G AKA bypass

This exploit utilizes $I_8$ 5G AKA Bypass from paper [Logic Gone Astray: A Security Analysis Framework for the Control Plane Protocols of 5G Basebands](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/tu). Only the Pixel 7 phone with the Exynos modem is affected.
After receiving `Registration Request` from the UE, Sni5Gect injects the plaintext `Registration Accept` message with security header 4. The UE will ignore the wrong MAC, accept the `Registration Accept` message, and reply with `Registration Complete` and `PDU Session Establishment Requests`. Since the core network receives such unexpected messages, it instructs the gNB to release the connection by sending the `RRC Release` message to terminate the connection immediately.

```conf
exploit: modules/lib_plaintext_registration_accept.so
```

Example output:
![Registration_Accept](./images/registration_accept.png)
